    "Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for various applications. One of the most common tasks that programmers perform in their projects is handling files and directories. Python provides several libraries to help developers manage files and directories easily and efficiently. The pathlib1 library is one of the most commonly used libraries for file handling in Python. In this tutorial, we will cover the basic concepts of file paths, the basic functionalities of pathlib, including how to create paths, navigate directories, and manipulate files. We'll start with the basics of creating and accessing paths, and then move on to more advanced topics like file and directory manipulation.By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a good understanding of how to use pathlib to manage your file system operations efficiently and reliably. So, let's get started!"

    "## Basic concepts of file paths\n",
    "In computing, a file path is the unique location of a file or directory in a file system. It is typically represented as a string of characters that identifies the file or directory's location in the file system hierarchy. The file path consists of one or more directory names separated by a delimiter, such as a forward slash (/) or backslash (\\), followed by the file name. There are two types of file paths: absolute and relative. An absolute file path provides the complete location of the file or directory in the file system, starting from the root directory. For example, on a Unix-like system, the root directory is represented as /, so an absolute file path for a file named example.txt located in the myfolder directory inside the root directory would be /myfolder/example.txt.A relative file path, on the other hand, provides the location of the file or directory relative to the current working directory. The current working directory is the directory in which the Python script is executed. For example, if the Python script is executed in the myfolder directory, a relative file path for a file named example.txt located in the same directory would be ./example.txt, where the . represents the current directory.It is important to note that file paths can vary depending on the operating system. For example, on Windows, file paths are represented using backslashes (\\) instead of forward slashes (/), and the root directory is represented as a drive letter, such as C:\\. Understanding file paths is essential for performing file operations in Python, and both pathlib and os libraries (os isa library we are going to see in another tutorial) provide functions to work with file paths in a platform-independent way.\n"
